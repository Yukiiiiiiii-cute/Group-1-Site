        <p>
            A girl named Louise transferred to APEC school during grade 10. Louise happened to be annoyed with the outgoing personality of a boy named Felix who is known for being an extrovert. And when their teacher, Ms. Bautista announced the groupings for IPBA, here came a surprise, and the two found themselves in one group.<br><br>

            Felix was everything Louise wasn't. He was outgoing, charismatic, and seemed to know everybody in school. Initially, Louise was irritated with him as he never stopped talking, wanting to be everybody's best buddy. However, once she had to work on her own IPBA along with Felix, things started looking up for him. She began admiring the confidence and speed at which he could make every other person laugh around him. To her surprise, she even enjoyed his company.<br><br>

            It eventually turned out that Felix secretly had been in love with Louise from the very moment he'd met her. He had been attracted towards the quiet confidence that surrounded her with an air of mystery. He was also impressed by the fact that she never seemed to try too hard, about things or how she tended to speak her mind.<br><br>

            Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. That was how their friendship between Louise and Felix began. They spent all of their free time talking and laughing, getting to know each other further. And before they knew it, their feelings for each other had grown into something more.<br><br>

            After high school, Louise and Felix both went off to college, took jobs, and eventually decided to get married. Louise could not have been any happier knowing she had found her soulmate in Felix.<br><br>

            At last, when they were at their wedding venue, Felix collapsed onto the floor because of heart disease he kept secret from all, including Louise. Felix could not be saved; he died before he was transported to a nearby hospital.<br><br>

            Louise's heart was broken into a million pieces. She could hardly think of the fact that the man who loved her more than life had left and was unable to even imagine living without him. She felt hysterical for days, unable to understand and fathom how fate could play so cruelly with it and pry Felix away from her just as they were about to begin their new life together.
